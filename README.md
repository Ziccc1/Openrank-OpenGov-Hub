# OpenGov Hub

An all-in-one open source governance and operation monitoring dashboard tailored for developers, enterprise OSPOs, project maintainers, and regulators. Built on open-source projects like OpenDigger, MaxKB, SQLBot, and DataEase, it aggregates global open source ecosystem data to deliver real-time insights, risk alerts, efficiency diagnostics, and actionable recommendations.

## Core Capabilities

- **Global Ecosystem Insight**: Visualize global project distribution via heatmaps, compare core metrics (OpenRank, commit volume, PR acceptance rate) between top global institutions/contributors and Chinese counterparts, and track trending tech topics through word clouds.

- **Health & Efficiency Monitoring**: Multi-dimensional project health analysis (activity, collaboration efficiency, influence) via heatmaps and radar charts; track PR/Issue processing times by type (bug fixes, feature requests, optimizations) with interactive stacked bar charts.

- **Intelligent Alerts & AI Assistance**: Shorten risk detection cycles from 18 days to 24 hours; integrate MaxKB for natural language interactions, enabling non-technical users to query governance advice and risk mitigation strategies.

- **Cross-Dimensional Linkage**: Analyze data across "region-institution-project" levels with drill-down capabilities, supporting four-dimensional cross-analysis without performance lag.

## Key Value

Address China's open source ecosystem challenges (insufficient core project influence, poor project health, long risk detection cycles) by shifting governance from fragmented tools/experience-based judgment to data-driven, integrated management. Lower participation barriers, boost collaboration efficiency, and drive the ecosystem from scale growth to quality improvement.

## Target Users

- **Enterprise OSPOs**: Monitor project cluster risks and target project health in real time.
- **Developers**: Optimize work priorities, improve PR processing efficiency, and address high-latency Issues.
- **Investors**: Gain insights into ecosystem trends, project distribution, and health for data-backed decision-making.
